=head1 DESCRIPTION

RapidApp is an extension to L<Catalyst> - the Perl-based MVC framework. It provides a feature-rich
extended development stack, as well as easy access to common out-of-the-box application paradigms, 
such as powerful CRUD-based front-ends for L<DBIx::Class> models, user access and authorization, 
RESTful URL navigation schemes, pure Ajax interfaces with no browser page loads, templating engine 
with front-side CMS features, declarative configuration layers, and more...

RapidApp is useful not only for new application development, but also for adding admin interfaces to 
existing Catalyst applications, as well as for rapid prototyping.

RapidApp started as an internal project in 2009 and has been under continuous development
ever since. It has been used very successfully for multiple medium to large-scale client 
applications (backends with hundreds of tables and tens of millions of rows) as well as 
many quick and easy apps and interfaces for smaller jobs.

We started open-sourcing RapidApp in 2013, and this work is ongoing...

RapidApp is built on top of a number of powerful open-source tools and technologies including:

Documentation is still a work-in-progress. Much of it has been done, but much of it still
remains to be done: L<RapidApp::Manual>.
